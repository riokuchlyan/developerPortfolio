        <h1>Route 206 Bypass Opens in Hillsborough, New Jersey</h1>    
            <p>
                The high anticipated bypass in route 206 has finally opened for use in Hillsborough, New Jersey. It is a <b>3.6 mile highway</b> located between Mountain View Road and Old Somerville Road. The plan was conceived in 1970 meaning that the project has been ongoing for over 50 years. Finally, the bypass has opened.
            </p>
        <h2>The Purpose of the Route 206 Bypass</h2>
            <p>
                The route 206 will provide relief to the thousands of commuters that travel there daily. According to the Department of Transportation, <q>30,000 vehicles use the Route 206 Hillsborough corridor daily.</q> However, the bypass isn't completly finished. <cite>New Jersey 101.5</cite> states, <q>New Jersey DOT still has some finishing touches to complete on the project including the lane widening between Valley Road and Doctors Way. Other future projects include widening and limited access improvements that will make the highway four lanes all the way north to Somerville.</q>
            </p>
        <h2>How the Bypass Will Improve the City</h2>
            <p>
                The new bypass will greatly reduce traffic jams in the area. Additonally, it will provide incentives for more infrastructure projects in the future such as the recent construction of a new aparment complex, all without any compromises. <cite>Tapinto </cite> states, <q>The construction and bridge improvements will be completed in stages to maintain two-way directional traffic and allow access to all properties throughout the duration of the construction project.</q> Such measures will ensure that infrastructure projects like the bypass do not affect the functionality of the town. The bypass is a <em>great leap forward</em> for this town.
